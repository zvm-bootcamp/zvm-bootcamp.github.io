It is the layer between the hardware and virtual machines. Each virtual machine appears to have its own CPU, storage (memory), and devices. In reality, these items can be:","Real. For example, you can dedicate a real network interface to a virtual machine for its exclusive use.","Shared. For example, the CPU is shared through time sharing and real storage is shared as virtual storage.","Simulated. For example, a virtual switch is a simulated LAN networking switch. CP transparently maps virtual devices and resources to their real counterparts.","Emulated. For example, FBA emulated SCSI disks. The EDEVICE statements allow us to define emulated devices that represent real devices to CP. This means SCSI devices.","The following topics explain how CP manages computer resources for virtual machines."]},{"i":"central-processing-units-cpus","l":"Central processing units (CPUs)","p":["& An IBM z13 server can have up to 141 processors. & An IBM zEnterprise EC12 server can have up to 101 processors. & z13 can have up to 80 LPARs, an increase from 65 in zEC12 & A Logical Partition can now have up to 141processors defined in z13 (101 for zEC12) & A z/VM LPAR can have up to 64 logical processors if SMT is disabled or 32 logical processors defined if SMT is enabled. & Virtual processors (or virtual CPUs) in single virtual machine (architected): 64 && But NVirtual > NLogical is not usually practical & If capable of running in multiprocessor mode, your virtual machine operating system dispatches work on its virtual CPUs as if it were running on real hardware. CP handles the dispatching of work on your virtual CPUs to real CPUs. & Guideline: Never give a virtual machine more virtual CPUs than there are real CPUs.","Usually virtual machines share all CPUs, but a real CPU can be dedicated to a virtual machine, which means that the CPU is reserved for that virtual machine's exclusive use. This obviously has an impact on the performance of other virtual machines in the system."]},{"l":"Storage","p":["Mainframe storage is analogous to memory in a personal computer. CP commands refer to memory as storage, so do not confuse the term\"storage\" with disk or tape storage.","Each virtual machine has its own virtual storage. CP manages the residency of virtual machine's pages in real storage through paging. Pages that have not been referenced can be moved out of real storage into a paging device. When a virtual machine requires a page no longer in real storage, a page fault occurs and CP brings the missing page back into real storage.","CP has facilities that allow portions of real storage to be shared by many virtual machines. Such portions are called shared segments. This sharing economizes on real storage and requires less paging, thereby improving performance. For example, the CMS nucleus is shared in real storage by all virtual machines that loaded CMS by name; that is, every CMS virtual machine maps a 1 MB segment of virtual storage to the same 1 MB of real storage."]},{"l":"DASD and minidisks","p":["DASD, the mainframe term for disk drives, stands for \"direct access storage device\" and is analogous to a hard disk drive on a personal computer. A single real DASD is called a volume or real volume. Each volume has a label or volume serial number (volser) that identifies the volume to z/VM.","It is important to understand the way that z/VM shares DASD. CP can logically partition real DASD volumes into minidisks, which is analogous to dividing a personal computer hard disk into multiple partitions. A minidisk has its own label, which is distinct from the real DASD label. Each virtual machine can have one or more minidisks and those minidisks are under control of the guest operating system."]},{"l":"Temporary minidisks","p":["You can create a temporary minidisk from a special pool of real disks. The disk lasts as long as the virtual machine is logged on. At logoff, the temporary minidisk is deleted and the space returned to the available temporary disk pool."]},{"l":"Virtual Disks in storage","p":["Virtual disks in storage are similar to temporary minidisks, except the disks are mapped to storage rather than the cylinders of real disks. Using virtual disks in storage avoids the need for disk I/O. CP manages the virtual disk pages as part of its real memory management."]},{"i":"virtual-readers-punches-and-printers","l":"Virtual readers, punches, and printers","p":["These devices are not associated with real devices, but are implemented through the spool file system.","In the early days of computing, input to the computer came from punched cards loaded into a card reader. You used a key punch to record your program on punched cards, then loaded the cards into a card reader, which interpreted your cards and loaded your program into the computer. Output from the program was written to a printer. z/VM preserves this bit of computing history through virtual reader, punch, and printer devices, also called unit record devices. Unit record devices provide a handy way to send files from one virtual device to another, to other virtual machines, or to real devices (such as real printers). For instance, you can think of a file being sent from one virtual machine to another as the virtual equivalent of taking a card stack from one computer and loading the stack onto another computer's card reader.","Behind the manipulation of these files is a CP file system called the spool file system. CP manages spool files on one or more DASD volumes that act as temporary storage areas. A spool file is a collection of data along with device control instructions for processing on a unit record device. Spooling is the processing of files created by or intended for virtual readers, punches, and printers. Through CP and CMS commands, you can send spool files from one virtual device to another, from your virtual machine to another, and to real devices.","By convention, each virtual machine has a virtual reader at virtual device number 00C, a virtual punch at virtual device number 00D, and a virtual printer at virtual device number 00E. Your virtual reader is like the in-box of an e-mail system, except more than just e-mail can be placed there. Through your virtual punch, you can place a copy of an entire operating system into the system spool, then use the CP IPL command to load and run that operating system in your virtual machine."]},{"l":"The virtual machine console","p":["The virtual machine console or virtual console is the primary interface to the virtual machine. When you log on to a virtual machine from a local terminal or a remote workstation, the virtual console is associated with the terminal session. From the console, you can enter CP commands, such as loading (IPL) an operating system. The virtual console is the device an operating system views as its system or hardware console.","As you do work on your console, the lower right corner of the screen displays various status notices. The notices tell you what is happening in the system at the present time. If you forget what these notices mean, you can come back to this section for reference.","CP READ This notice means that the Control Program (CP) is waiting for you to enter a command.","Console Status"]},{"l":"The User Directory","p":["The z/VM user directory (or user registry) describes the configuration and operating characteristics of each virtual machine that can be created by CP.

For CMS, each minidisk has an access mode represented by an alphabetic letter that determines how CMS searches for files. In Linux, path variables defining directories determine the search order for files. CMS searches for files among minidisks based on the alphabetical order of the access mode. First, CMS looks on the A minidisk, then the B minidisk, and so forth. The 191 minidisk holds a special place in CMS. A 191 minidisk to a CMS user is like the home file directory for a Linux user. CMS always tries to access a user's 191 minidisk as access mode A. The CMS 191 minidisk is often called the \"A-disk\"."]},{"l":"CMS Files","p":["CMS files have a file name, file type, and file mode. File names and file types can be up to 8 characters long. The file mode corresponds to the access mode of the minidisk. Examples:","By convention, some file types have special meanings. For example, EXEC is the file type for a file that contains executable statements, LISTING is the file type for text files, and LISTPS is the file type for PostScript files. To view and manipulate files, use the FILELIST command(Or LISTFILE command). FILELIST is similar to the dir command in Linux."]},{"l":"PROFILE EXEC","p":["The PROFILE EXEC is a special executable file analogous to the .profile(or .bash_profile) in Linux and UNIX.

You can use the PROFILE EXEC to set up your virtual machine environment; for instance, access disks, set up special PF keys, or even load another operating system in your virtual machine.","There can be times when you do not want the PROFILE EXEC to execute when you log on. For example, assume your PROFILE EXEC automatically loads Linux. If you have just shut down Linux and want to start CMS, but prevent Linux from being loaded again, you can prevent CMS from executing the PROFILE EXEC by issuing access (noprof.

HiperSockets provides near zero latency at memory speed communications between servers running in different LPARs. When connecting a Linux guest to an IBM z/OS system on the Mainframe, the HiperSockets network in Layer 3 mode is the method to use. HiperSockets must be configured in the I/O configuration of the Mainframe. HiperSockets do not provide external connections. If an external connection is required, either a HiperSockets bridge must be implemented by using a VSWITCH, or a Linux guest must be set up as a router.","HiperSockets provide a very fast connection between LPARs. They provide an easy way to connect many Linux servers to a z/OS system in the same Mainframe.

Directory management is simplified by DirMaint's command interface and automated facilities. DirMaint's directory statement-like commands are used to add, delete or alter the directory. DirMaint's error checking ensures that only valid changes are made to the directory, and that only authorized personnel are able to make the requested changes. Any transaction requiring the allocation or deallocation of minidisk extents can be handled automatically. All user-initiated transactions are password controlled, and are recorded for auditing purposes.","If a volume is normally attached to the system using a USER_VOLUME_INCLUDE statement, CP does not notify the operator if the volume is not mounted.

The panel below is an example:","When the system shuts down and re-IPLs, you will see a number of IPL messages. z/VM restores the system to the same state as it was prior to shutdown (for instance, with OPERATOR disconnected).","When the TCPIP virtual machine is started, TCP/IP operation and configuration parameters are read from an initial configuration file. TCP/IP searches for an initial configuration file in the following order and uses the first file present in that order:","When you get it filled as needed press F5 to submit your request or F3 to cancel it.","When z/VM IPLs, normally the AUTOLOG1 virtual machine is logged on(unless the NOAUTOLOG parameter is specified at IPL). Its PROFILE EXEC is run when CMS IPLs. Using this file, perform the following tasks:","Where <n> is the reader id that will show at the begging of the response.","Where:","Which controller is your primary?","While various TCP/IP virtual machines have specific definition requirements, all TCP/IP servers must maintain links to the following minidisks, to allow for correct operation:","You can aggregate multiple physical OSA cards in to a single logical link, which is called a link aggregation group (LAG). This configuration increases the bandwidth and provides nondisruptive failover. How to co nfigure it is well described on Advanced Networking Concepts Applied Using Linux on IBM System z, SG24-7995.","You can disable an amount of memory using \"-d\" option:","You can execute /etc/init.d/boot.local to test the new settings:","You can initially configure TCP/IP via the IPWIZARD command which is generally used just once. After IPWIZARD creates the initial configuration files, they are typically maintained manually.","You can now access this Linux system using SSH.","You can query DIRECTORY definitions info executing:","You can query your new group information using the following commad:","You can read more about VSWITCH benefits on Set up Linux on IBM System z for Production, SG24-8137, and technical information about Advanced Networking Concepts Applied Using Linux on IBM System z, SG24-7995.","You can use a terminal server to achieve these goals:","You know you are done when you have access to the CF0 disk and have created a backup of SYSTEM CONFIG on the parm disk.","You need to:","You should now see something like the following:","You will see a file like the following:","You will see something like this file:","You will see something like this:","Your Linux first image is now ready!","Your system identifier should be ZVMWSxx. The system identifier is also displayed at the lower right hand corner of your console."]}]]
